#### Frequently asked questions
**Q:** **I am not seeing any search results, what is wrong?**<br>
**A:** If you haven't already, register an account on https://vk.com. If you already have an account, but still are not getting any results, make sure that you have typed in your credentials correctly in the app.

**Q:** **I am seeing only some search results, what is wrong?**<br>
**A:** Vk.com imposed a regional block on its content. A workaround is to use a proxy or a VPN from Russia.
